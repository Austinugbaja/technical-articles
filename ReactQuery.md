# Implementing and Leveraging React Query for Efficient State Management in React Applications

## What is React Query?

React query is a popular library for managing and fetching data in a react application. It is designed to be simple, lightweight and very easy to use, making it a great choice for developers who want to manage their application's state without the complexity of a fully-featured library like Redux. 

In this article we'll look at how to implement react query in a react project and discuss some of the benefits it offers over other state management alternatives such as React Context API, React-redux toolkit, Recoil, etc.


## Implementing React Query in a React project

To get started with react query, you'll first need to install it in your react project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal.

```js
npm install react-query

yarn add react-query
```
Next, you'll need to wrap your root component with the `Querycache()` provider. This is a higher order component that provides the **`querycache`** object to all of your components which you'll use to manage all your queries.

```js
import { QueryCache, ReactQueryCacheProvider } from 'react-query';


    const queryCache = new QueryCache();

    const App = () => {
        return (
            <ReactQueryCacheProvider queryCache={QueryCache}>
                {/* Your component goes here */}
            </ReactQueryCacheProvider>
        )
    }
```
